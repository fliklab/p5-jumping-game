# Game Project Readme

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a 2D side-scrolling jump game. Players control a character to avoid various obstacles and progress through stages, with increasing difficulty as the game progresses.

## Features

- **Game Start**: Press the spacebar to start the game.
- **Character Control**: Use the spacebar for jumping and double jumping.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Navigate through various obstacles as you progress.
- **Stage Progression**: Complete each stage and move on to the next.
- **Game End**: The game displays a final ending screen upon completing all stages.

## Technology Stack

- **JavaScript**: Implementation of game logic.
- **p5.js**: Handling graphics and animations.
- **HTML/CSS**: Construction of the game interface.
